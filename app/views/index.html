            <li>prototype created</li>

          <p>Research showed:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>some users wrongly thought the service is to apply for a Blue Badge</li>
            <li>some users would drop out if they had to create an ID account</li>
            <li>all users were able to select their council from 4 radio buttons</li>

            <li>all users were confused about what the reference code is for and what to do next on the last page</li>

          <p>Caveats:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>we don't know yet what the best way for users to prove who they are is (Government Gateway is just one example)
            <li>private beta will cover information sharing for a small number of councils</li>
            <li>this version is for a stand-alone service for citizens who apply for a Blue Badge using their local council's online service or paper form</li>
            <li>we need to test a version that is part of a seamless Apply for a Blue Badge service
            <li>this version is the happy path user journey – we also need to test an unhappy path journey</li>
