      <p>Changes:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>prototype created</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Research showed:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>some users incorrectly thought the service was to apply for a Blue Badge</li>
        <li>some users said they would drop out if they had to create an ID account</li>
        <li>users are able to select their council from 4 radio buttons</li>
        <li>after entering their postcode, some users expected to see a list of addresses to select – but address isn't needed</li>
        <li>users understand what will happen to their PIP or DLA when they click the 'Send to your council' button</li>
        <li>on the completed page all users were confused about what the reference code was for and what they had to do next</li>
      </ul>


      <p>Caveats:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>we don't know yet what the best way for users to prove who are they are is (Government Gateway is just one example)
        <li>private beta will cover information sharing for a small number of councils</li>
        <li>this version is for a stand-alone service for citizens who apply for a Blue Badge using their local council's online service or paper form</li>
        <li>we need to test a version that is part of a seamless Apply for a Blue Badge service
        <li>this version is the happy path user journey – we also need to test an unhappy path journey</li>
      </ul>
